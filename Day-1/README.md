Introduction to DevOps:

DevOps is a collaborative approach that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
Deployment refers to the process of moving code from development or testing environments into production, where users can access it. It can be manual or automated using tools like Jenkins, Docker or Kubernetes.
Testing ensures that the application works as expected. It can include unit testing, integration testing, system testing and automated testing as part of Continuous Integration (CI).
